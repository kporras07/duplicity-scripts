## Remote backup script. Requires duplicity and gpg-agent with the keys and passphrases loaded as root.
## Uses separate encryption and signing keys
## Usage: 'backup_remote.sh'

# Keychain is used to source the ssh-agent keys when running from a cron job
type -P keychain &>/dev/null || { echo "I require keychain but it's not installed. Aborting." >&2; exit 1; }
eval `keychain --eval web_rsa` || exit 1
## Note: can't use keychain for gpg-agent because it doesn't currently (2.7.1) read in all the keys correctly..
## Gpg will ask for a passphrase twice for each key...once for encryption/decryption and once for signing..
## This makes unattended backups impossible, especially when trying to resume an interrupted backup.
